# This is a calorie calculator.

# take input from user (height, weight, sex*)
# translate these values into a BMI values (math function)
# translate the BMI value into the ideal daily calorie intakeï¼Œ preferably a range (math function)
# design a one day diet according to the calorie range (including breakfast, lunch, dinner)
    # we can design a total of 20 diets for example, each have a different calorie content. then, we can randomly choose one that is within the range of the calorie intake
    # for instance, if the ideal calorie intake is from 1500-2000, the function will randomly return diets within that range
# ask the user if he or she is vegan(?)
# if yes, return a vegan diet
# if no, return a normal diet
# ask the user if he or she wants a snack (if yes, return a snack)
# print out the diet in a pretty format
# ask if the user want another day's diet
# if yes, circle back
# if not, exit the program
